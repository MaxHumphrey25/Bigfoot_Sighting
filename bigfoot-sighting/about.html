      <h2>About the Band</h2>
      <div class="about-content">
        <p>
          Originating from Geelong, Victoria, <strong>Bigfoot Sighting</strong> introduces a blend of folk, post-hardcore, and rock into the indie scene. The band — a group of high school friends reconnecting through their love of Title Fight and tolerance of emo vocals — harmonises in their music, introducing a familiar yet innovative sound into a flourishing music scene.
        </p>

        <p>
          The band, consisting of two guitarists, a bassist, a drummer, and a vocalist, mix their differing tastes in music to create a sound that stands apart from many other indie bands. This adaptive approach, merging diverging styles and genres, allows Bigfoot Sighting's music to defy genre limits — pushing forward a fresh approach to making music in a saturated scene.

            <strong>Zach Parker</strong>, the lead guitarist, was the Sisyphus of the group...

        <p>
          Bigfoot Sighting began with one person. At that stage, it wasn't really a band — more of an idea. <strong>Zach Parker</strong>, the lead guitarist, was the Sisyphus of the group, pushing the boulder that would become Bigfoot Sighting. Without his dedication to writing and organising, the band wouldn't exist.
        </p>

        <p>
          The next to join was <strong>Max Humphrey</strong>, the bassist. One issue: Max didn't know how to play bass. But his rapid grasp of the basics shaped the band's early songs, with bassline complexity growing over time and helping define the band's evolving sound.
        </p>

        <p>
          A chance meeting at Ocean Grove's local Ampol petrol station brought <strong>Felix Walsh</strong> into the band as drummer. Originally a guitarist, his unique drum rhythms helped glue the group's multi-guitar sound together.
        </p>

        <p>
          Next came <strong>Joel Fletcher</strong>, the band's explosive vocalist — known for projecting his voice louder than any microphone. Demanding the band cover every Strokes song ever made and famously obsessed with Weezer, Joel brought both energy and a finely tuned musical ear to the group.
        </p>

        <p>
          The final piece was <strong>Alfie Mason</strong>, an international addition as backup guitarist. Alfie's timing and style added stability and structure, enhancing Zach's creative leads with balance and grace.
        </p>

        <p>
          Originally called <strong>Azoic</strong> — a name meaning "without life" — the band quickly pivoted from that bleak title (which Joel described as "a bit too metal"). Under the Azoic name, they recorded two singles: <em>Hard to Admire</em> and <em>Manic and Avoidant</em>. These early tracks tested the band's recording ability, created using only a basic audio interface, a poor microphone, and a closet with way too much echo.
